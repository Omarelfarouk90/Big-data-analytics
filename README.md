The smart grid system requires information about the consumer demand and the amount of the supplied energy, as well as the estimated grid stability to create new pricing for each energy unit sustainability of the smart grid system. Our research aims to predict and analyze the changes in energy production and consumption relative to the energy prices in a decentralized smart grid system, by performing BDA for a large dataset. To identify the grid stability for the distributed smart grid system, a mathematical model was presented in (Sch√§fer et al., 2016) for a four-node star architecture, with one energy source supplying three consumption nodes as displayed in , the model considers
three input features; total power balance, energy price elasticity, and response time to price changes
